set up git for everyone
	paul and I have it working, mine was a pain in the butt :(

	To push:
	git add .
	git commit -m "insert message here"
	git push

	To pull: 
	git pull

	Reminder: you have to pull the latest changes before you can push.
	Also if we are working on the same file simultaneously things can get weird, so let's try not to do that


we asked Tong what the best way of creating a database-driven website was...
he said we should use Yii
	http://www.yiiframework.com/
So I guess the next step is we all download this thing, play around with it in the tutorials, and get it to integrate with NetBeans

Tong said he likes using NetBeans the best...I've never really done webdevelopment so I'm gonna download it and figure out how to use it...but whatever IDE you want to use is a personal choice

We all need a local version of Apache Webserver running
	http://www.apache.org/

Soooo, from here we should probably figure out what we want to do on the website?
	1. How do we want it to look?
	2. What features do we give it?
	3. What's our menu?

	Things like that

It's due April 27th, so we've got:
2/24
3/2
3/9
3/16
3/23
3/30
4/6
4/13
4/20 blazeit
4/27

10 weeks, not bad
