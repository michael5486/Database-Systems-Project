Hi Professor,

Our website is currently accessible at http://52.70.106.129/

You can go online and see it in action. Click the login button, create an account, and then login using our username and password. You will be taken to an order screen, where you can place items into your cart. THe Remove All button will remove all of a selected item from your cart. Once finished, you can then add a tip, and then press checkout. You will then be taken to another page, where you can enter in your credit card details and any special instructions for the chef. Then you will be taken to another page, where you can give the items you ordered a rating.

Thanks,

Ali, Michael and Paul
